# Movie & Book Recommendation System

Welcome to the Movie & Book Recommendation System! This application was developed for the 2024 Hackathon: Assistants-api-llamaindex-mongodb-battle. The primary function of this app is to provide movie and/or book recommendations based solely on the user's description of the movie.

## Roadmap

The development of the Movie & Book Recommendation System is divided into the following stages:

1. **Data Filtering and Preprocessing:**
   - Collection of raw data from reliable sources.
   - Filtering of data to remove any irrelevant information.
   - Cleaning and preprocessing of data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
   - Transformation of data into a format suitable for our machine learning models.

2. **RAG Pipeline with LLamaindex, GPT-4, and MongoDB Vector Database:**
    - Development of a MongoDB vector database for storing and querying vector representations of data.
    - Implementation of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.
    - Integration of LLamaindex for efficient data indexing and retrieval.
    - Use of GPT-4 for generating high-quality text based on user input.


3. **LLM Testing with TruLens:**
   - Evaluation of the Language Learning Model (LLM) using TruLens to ensure its performance and reliability.
   - Identification and rectification of any issues or discrepancies in the LLM.
   - Continuous testing and improvement of the LLM based on user feedback and performance metrics.
